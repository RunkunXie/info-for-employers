**This project develops a risk calculation system.** 

The system is able to:

1. Take a portfolio of stock and option positions as inputs.
2. Both calibrate to historical data or take parameters as inputs.
3. Compute Monte Carlo, historical, and parametric VaR.
4. Compute Monte Carlo, and historical Expected Shortfall.
5. Backtest the computed VaR against history.
