####   2.1 risk-calculation-system:

  This project develops a risk calculation system for portfolios containing stocks and options. It calculate portfolio VaRs and ESs, and backtest them against history.

####   2.2 stock-prediction-using-deep-learning

  This project predicted price trends of stock indexes and index futures using Deep Learning models (including ANN, RNN, LSTM), built trading strategies based on various trained models, and found that the LSTM-based high-frequency trading strategy achieved 2.38 sharpe ratio and outcompeted other models.
