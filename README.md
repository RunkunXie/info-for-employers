I use this repo to store some useful information for employers, including:

### **1 Resume**

### 2 Projects and Code Samples

####   2.1 risk-calculation-system:

  This project develops a risk calculation system for portfolios containing stocks and options. It calculate portfolio VaRs and ESs, and backtest them against history.

####   2.2 stock-prediction-using-deep-learning

  This project predicted price trends of stock indexes and index futures using Deep Learning models (including ANN, RNN, LSTM), built trading strategies based on various trained models, and found that the LSTM-based high-frequency trading strategy achieved 2.38 sharpe ratio and outcompeted other models.

#### 2.3 multi-digit-number-recognition-using-deep-convolutional-neural-networks

  In this project, we apply deep convolution neural network (Ian et al., 2013) to raw street view images directly. We trained our model on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset, and our best model achieves 86.02% accuracy on the test dataset.
